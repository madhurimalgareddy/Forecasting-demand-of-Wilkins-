### Introduction
Every week, the same problem arose at the local grocery store: either the shelves were emptied too quickly, leaving customers disappointed, or excess stock remained unsold, leading to waste. The question was clearâ€”how could customer demand be predicted more accurately?

This project addresses that challenge by leveraging data-driven techniques to forecast demand, helping businesses strike the perfect balance between supply and demand.This project involves demand forecasting of Wilkins Company which specializes in producing high-quality plumbing products.
